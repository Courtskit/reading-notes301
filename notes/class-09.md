## Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

**Functional Programming** 

Pure Functions - function that returns the same result if given the same arguments

Functions that can change include:
- functions with outside links
- random number generators

Immutable - will not change over time

Slugify:
- toLowerCase
- trim
- split
- join 

Higher-order Functions
- takes one or more functions as arguments
OR
- returns a function as its result 

- filter, map, reduce
